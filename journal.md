2020-11-12 Started this repo! I hope in the end it'll contain useful tidbits I
    picked up along the journey, as well as any custom dictionaries I develop.
    Some historical background on the journey so far is below. Going forward,
    I don't want this journal to be just a list of wpm counts and times (though
    I'll certainly include some for milestone tracking). The last few times I
    dusted off the steno machine I ended up putting a lot of effort into time-
    and wpm-tracking, so much that it became Not Very Fun Any More. So less of
    that from now on, focussing on the fun parts instead!
2020-02-20 [historical] 1 day of practice in February. 13wpm on Georgi.
2019-12-16 [historical] 1 day of practice in December. Still hovering around 10
    wpm on Georgi (using Typey-Type). I started punctuation though!
2019-11-25 [historical] 4 days of practice in October. 1 in November.
2019-10-06 [historical] That stint in August lasted 5 days. Seeing a pattern...
    It's ok though. I'm having fun with this when I have fun. Any practical
    effects will be a nice bonus, but not worth beating myself up about if I
    don't achieve.
    In August I got up to about 16 wpm on Typey-Type with the SOFT/HRUF.
    Now I'm using the Georgi, around 13 wpm on Typey-Type
2019-08-25 [historical] That stint in May lasted 4 days. Back at it now. 10 wpm
    on Typey-Type with the SOFT/HRUF.
2019-05-12 [historical] I took baseline typing speed tests at www.typingtest.com
    with my 2015 macbook air and WASD v2 keyboards: 73 and 76 wpm, respectively.
    I also started learning the SOFT/HRUF machine, with an initial count of 8
    wpm on Typey-Type.
