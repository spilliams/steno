- 2020-11-15 Upgraded to Plover v4.0.0. When they say "back up your plover.cfg"
    that file is in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\plover\plover\`.
    Wondering if there's a way to stay accountable for daily activity without
    bloating this journal file.
- 2020-11-14 journaling with steno now! ok back to qwerty. that took a few
    minutes, but I'm having fun learning about the control mechanisms (to
    insert a space or not, to capitalize or not), as well as punctuation and
    positioning chords. I'd like to try to find a testimonial about Plover's
    "space placement" option (before or after chord output). I feel like that
    option may (a) have a medium to large impact on the workflow for coding vs
    prose, and (b) be really hard to re-train later.
- 2020-11-13 Got a little practice in. I realized I'm not yet ready to fully
    drop the progress-tracking. My reasoning is that I'm doing this from at
    least 2 different computers still, and Typey Type doesn't have user
    accounts, so if I want to track progress there I should copy the file down
    after every session.  
    Thankfully I was able to quickly build a CLI tool that will help me merge
    two JSON files into one, summing the values along the way. That should
    help in the task of saving the progress JSON at least.  
    I also remembered that because Georgi only has the two rows for my fingers
    instead of a steno machine's standard 3, the third thumb button (on both
    sides) is my number bar modifier.  
    I wonder again how I might use the extra two pinky keys on the left side
    too, since I probably won't need--wait...i'm not so terrible at georgi qwerty! [that last phrase only took several minutes to puzzle out, and
    even then i didn't know all the punctuation keys]. Anyway, even while I'm
    doing steno I'll want a way to hit arbitrary shortcuts. That'll be
    interesting.
- 2020-11-12 Started this repo! I hope in the end it'll contain useful tidbits
    I picked up along the journey, as well as any custom dictionaries I develop.
    Some historical background on the journey so far is below. Going forward,
    I don't want this journal to be just a list of wpm counts and times (though
    I'll certainly include some for milestone tracking). The last few times I
    dusted off the steno machine I ended up putting a lot of effort into time-
    and wpm-tracking, so much that it became Not Very Fun Any More. So less of
    that from now on, focussing on the fun parts instead!
- 2020-02-20 [historical] 1 day of practice in February. 13wpm on Georgi.
- 2019-12-16 [historical] 1 day of practice in December. Still hovering around
    10 wpm on Georgi (using Typey Type). I started punctuation though!
- 2019-11-25 [historical] 4 days of practice in October. 1 in November.
- 2019-10-06 [historical] That stint in August lasted 5 days. Seeing a pattern...
    It's ok though. I'm having fun with this when I have fun. Any practical
    effects will be a nice bonus, but not worth beating myself up about if I
    don't achieve.  
    In August I got up to about 16 wpm on Typey Type with the SOFT/HRUF.  
    Now I'm using the Georgi, around 13 wpm on Typey Type.
- 2019-08-25 [historical] That stint in May lasted 4 days. Back at it now. 10
    wpm on Typey Type with the SOFT/HRUF.
- 2019-05-12 [historical] I took baseline typing speed tests at
    www.typingtest.com with my 2015 macbook air and WASD v2 keyboards: 73 and
    76 wpm, respectively.  
    I also started learning the SOFT/HRUF machine, with an initial count of 8
    wpm on Typey Type.
