I first bought the [SOFT/HRUF board](https://softhruf.love/). I found it to be
very tall, so I had some misadventures in making it shorter (replacing the
stock ethernet jacks with some ribbon cable jacks). I think I damaged the board
though, because it stopped working.

I then picked up a [Georgi](https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi). That
one was much thinner out of the box, but I had already gotten used to the
Matias red linear switches on the SOFT/HRUF, so I replaced the Kailh choc
switches on the Georgi.

I was also a little worried about the Georgi being just a bare board with no
enclosure, so I made a couple brass plates for it.

I remember I had to fuss with Plover a bit to get it to recognize the Georgi. I
also ended up flashing [my own firmware](https://github.com/spilliams/qmk_firmware/tree/43e013a829f01bbd003b0aec57c33666c5213606/keyboards/georgi/keymaps/spilliams)
to it to facilitate this.

My Plover (3.1.1) settings: TX Bolt machine, 9600 baud.
