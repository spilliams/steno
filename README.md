# steno

being a loose collection of things related to my learning stenography.

Here you will find:

- `cli`: source code for a CLI tool that helps with various tasks. See README
    in that folder for more.
- `dictionaries`: the various custom dictionaries I use on top of Plover's
    standards, plus various build artifacts from the CLI tool (which includes a
    dictionary generator).
- `notes`: contains a journal, my high-level goals, a description of the
    hardware I use, and my Typey Type proress file.

These resources are my main guides to learning this thing:

- the [Learn Plover! book](https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/) by Zack
    Brown
- the [Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/) founded by Mirabai
    Knight, and [Plover wiki](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki)
- [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) for practice and exercise
