# steno

being a loose collection of things related to my learning stenography.

Here you will find:

- goals: a high-level overview of the goals I have set for myself (and achieved)
- hardware: a current description of the steno machine I use, along with any
    useful tweaks I did to get it to work for me.
- journal: low-level details of how I achieved my goals, progress-tracking, etc.

These resources are my main guides to learning this thing:

- the [Learn Plover! book](https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/) by Zack Brown
- the [Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/) founded by Mirabai Knight, and [Plover wiki](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki)
- [Typey Type](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/) for practice and exercise
