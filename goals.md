Main Goals:
- [ ] have fun practicing new skills, doing research into a new thing I can be
    a nerd of.
- [ ] daily-drive steno for programming, comms (email/slack), and browsing.

Stepping-stones:
- [x] get a hardware setup so I can type in steno (see hardware.md)
- [x] get a software setup so computer can recognize hardware (Plover)
- [ ] reach a baseline (50wpm?) for prose
- [ ] fingerspelling, symbols, numbers
- [ ] operating system commands (alt-tab, ctrl-w, ctrl-t, ctrl-p)
    (Should I try installing a keylogger to see what other shortcuts I use most
    often in daily work?)
- [ ] learn how dictionaries work, and how to apply them in Plover
    (so I can do something like load a Golang dictionary and a VS Code
    dictionary and a Windows dictionary separately)
- [ ] miscellaneous briefs(?) for things like snake_case, camelCase, cap/decap
    previous word, etc. emoji?

Bonus goals (pipe dreams):
- [ ] 70wpm with prose
- [ ] a steno version of the rpi 400 (the keyboard IS the computer)
